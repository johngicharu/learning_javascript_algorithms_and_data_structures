  Object.keys() => O(n) => as the number of items increase, every single item is visited once. hence O of n
  Object.entries() => O(n) => similar to Object.keys(). While it is more work, it still does the same work
  Object.values() => O(n) => similar to above
  Object.hasOwnProperty("firstName") => O(1) => constant time
